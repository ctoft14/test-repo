"You miss 100 percent of the shots you never take." 
  - Tiger Gretzky

“I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.”
  —Michael Jordan
